The accuracy of the test was likely fairly accurate, I made sure to adhere to the procedures of the linear regression test.
As far as the applicable accuracy of the test in relation to real-world predictions on hits vs. at-bats, I'd say that is also quite accurate. With that said, 
it is not too hard to predict an increase in hits when at-bats are increased, so the value of the projection is likely not too high.

Outside of a generally accurate estimation of at-bats that lead to hits and subsequently batting average as it relates to an increase in at-bats, no, the results aren't 
particularly useful. The results lack the personalized hitting goals that every player brings to the plate during each at-bat. It more closely resembles a melting pot of 
talent and stats that results in a widely accessible statistic (league batting average).

I do have one question, I would love to know if it is possible to connect what I have created here to the Salaries.csv file that I also obtained. While I know this is 
certainly possible, I'm seeking to know whether it's achievable, which I think it likely is. I think it would make for an interesting independent project to relate
batting average to salary. I'd essentially like to find out how much any particular franchise pays for each hit a player makes in a season.
